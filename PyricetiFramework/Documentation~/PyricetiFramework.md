# About Pyriceti framework

Pyriceti framework is a framework I started to develop in order to capitalize the
experience I got working on previous projects. It is a homemade framework granting
some utilities, tools and architecture inspired by my greatest learnings and mistakes.

Feel free to use it for your own projects. I will try to update it and its documentation
as often as possible.
